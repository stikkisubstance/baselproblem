# baselproblem
Mathematician Euler solved a problem, namely the Basel problem, concerning the infinite sum of inverse squares, i.e. sum of n^-2 from n=1 to n=infinity.
He found out that the answer is (pi^2)/6, which is approximately 1.6449.
This solution to the problem is also the most convenient way to calculate pi, which this program is used for.
Therefore, to find the exact value of n for the formula "Î£(n^-2) = (pi^2)/6" ,this program is designed to show all steps to find it, automating them at the same time.
The ultimate goal for this program is to find the value of infinity, or the nearest value, by simplest means.
